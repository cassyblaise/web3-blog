Hello, I'm Obok Casimir(Cassyblaise) I'm a web developer and Web3 Evangelist. I am very passionate about technology and the solution it provides to everyday problems, so I want to be part of building even more advanced solutions to the problems in fields not yet explored. I'm an addictive learner, and always ready for new opportunities.
